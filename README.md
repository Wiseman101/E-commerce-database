## üîó Relationships

- Each **product** is linked to a **brand** and a **category**
- **Product items** are tied to specific **colors** and **sizes**
- **Images**, **attributes**, and **variations** are product-specific
- Foreign keys are used throughout to ensure referential integrity

## üîÑ Data Flow

1. **Admins** create brands, categories, colors, sizes, and attributes
2. Products are added and linked to these references
3. Specific product items are created by combining product + size + color
4. Customers browse the catalog via frontend, which queries this schema
